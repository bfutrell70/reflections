When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It allows your repository to be shared between people or computers.  Also it allows you to
    retrieve your repository if something were to happen to your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you have made changes locally pulling changes may affect those changes.
    It's almost the inverse of pushing to the remote repository manually versus
    doing it automatically.  With sending to the remote repository you only
    want to send changes that you want to be public.
