reflections for lesson 1

Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: It only showed differences between the two files, making it easier to locate the issue.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: It would make it easier to see how something was done in the past.  


Q: How might version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
A: If you commit changes on a working copy before making a change that
breaks the program, you can change the code back to the commit that works.

Q) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try
using Git for?
A) I want to be able to have code that I mess with in a common place
to make it easier to keep track of it between computers.  Also
want to be able to use version control in my projects.
